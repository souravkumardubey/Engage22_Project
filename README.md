  - Focus on any algorithm that you choose to highlight, for example:
    - Demonstrate what kind of role would a sorting algorithm play in a Recommendation Engine?
    - What is the most efficient sorting algorithm to use in this scenario, and why?
    - Demonstrate what kind of role would a search algorithm play in a Recommendation Engine? Which search algorithm does your app use, and why?
